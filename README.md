# simple_login-page
Summary
HTML provides the structure of the login page.
CSS styles the page to make it visually appealing.
JavaScript (optional) adds interactivity and validation to enhance user experience.
With these files, you have a basic yet functional login page. For a real application, you would need server-side handling for authentication and security considerations, which are not covered in this simple example.
